					<h3 style="color:yellow;">HISTORY</h3>
						<h4 style="color:white;"><br>Back in 1895, a man named William G. Morgan wanted to create a new sport that combined elements of basketball, baseball, tennis, and handball. He was the director of physical education at the YMCA in Holyoke, Massachusetts, and he wanted to create a game that could be played indoors during the winter months.
						Morgan’s new game was first called “Mintonette,” and it was played with a 6-foot 6-inch net and a ball that was about 25 inches in circumference. The original rules were simple: the ball could be hit with any part of the body, and there were no limits to the number of players on each team.<br>
						Initially, Mintonette was played with a 6-foot-high net and any number of players on each team. The objective of the game was to hit the ball back and forth over the net without it touching the ground. The game became popular quickly, and its name was changed to “Volleyball” in 1896.<br>
						In 1896, the first official volleyball game was played at Springfield College in Massachusetts. From there, volleyball grew in popularity and was played in YMCA centers and schools across the United States. In 1900, volleyball was added to the program of the Olympic Games, and it’s been a part of the Games ever since.<br>
						The original rules of volleyball were modified over time to create the game we know today. In 1916, the first international volleyball competition was held between the USA and Canada, and in 1947, the International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) was founded to govern the sport worldwide.<br>
						Today, volleyball is a global sport, played in countries all over the world. There are professional leagues, national teams, and countless amateur players who enjoy the game. And it all started with one man’s vision to create a new indoor sport.<br></h4>

					<h3 style="color:	yellow;">EQUIPMENTS BALL></h3>
						<h3 style="color:white;"><br>
							<h3 style="color:yellow;">Ball:</3>
								The volleyball is the main piece of equipment needed to play the game. It's a lightweight ball that is usually made of synthetic leather, and it measures about 65-67 centimeters in circumference. The ball should weigh between 260 and 280 grams and must be inflated to a pressure of 0.30 to 0.325 kg/cm².<br> 
							<h3 style="color:yellow;">Court:</3>
								The volleyball court is a rectangular area that measures 18 meters long and 9 meters wide. The court is divided into two equal halves by a net that is suspended from two poles. The court is further divided into two attack zones, which are marked by a line that extends 3 meters from the centerline on each side.<br>
							<h3 style="color:yellow;">Net:</3>
								The net is the most important piece of equipment in volleyball, as it separates the two teams and determines the height of the ball as it crosses over the net. The net measures 1 meter in width and 9.5 meters in length, and it is made of mesh material that is usually black in color. The top of the net should be 2.43 meters high for men and 2.24 meters high for women. <br>
							<h3 style="color:yellow;">Antenna:</3>
								The antenna is a vertical rod that is attached to the top of the net and extends 80 centimeters above it. The antenna helps players and officials determine whether a ball has crossed over the net inside or outside the court boundaries. The ball must pass between the antennas for it to be considered in play. <br> 
							<h3 style="color:yellow;">Other equipment:</3>
								Other equipment that players may use include knee pads, ankle braces, and athletic shoes. Knee pads help protect the knees from impact with the ground, while ankle braces provide support and stability to the ankle joint. Athletic shoes should provide good traction and support to the feet, as volleyball requires a lot of running and jumping.<br></h3>
