							Teamwork makes the dream work: Volleyball is a team sport, and it requires coordination, communication, and trust among teammates. Each team consists of six players on the court, with three in the front row and three in the back row. The objective is to score points by hitting the ball over the net and landing it in the opponent's court while preventing the other team from doing the same. <br><br>
				</h3></font>

				<h1 style="color:yellow;">
					Serving up success:<br>
				</h1>
		</center>
			<font color="white"><h3>		
				The game starts with a serve, where one player sends the ball over the net to the other side. The server must stand behind the end line and cannot step on or over it until after they make contact with the ball. The serve can be overhand or underhand, as long as it goes over the net and lands in the opponent's court. <br><br>
		</h3></font>

				<h1 style="color:yellow;">
					Three strikes and you're out: <br>
				</h1>
			</center>
			<font color="white"><h3>
				Each team has three touches to get the ball over the net. These touches can be any combination of bump, set, or spike. A player cannot touch the ball twice in a row, except in the case of a block. If a team fails to get the ball over the net in three touches, the other team gets a point. <br><br>
				</h3></font>

				<h1 style="color:yellow;">
						Netiquette matters: <br>
				</h1>
			</center>
				<font color="white"><h3>
						Players cannot touch the net during play. If the ball hits the net but still goes over, the game continues. However, if a player touches the net, it results in a point for the other team.<br><br>

				<h1 style="color:yellow;">
					Play it fair:<br>
				</h1>
		</center>		
			<font color="white"><h3>
				Volleyball is a non-contact sport, and players must not interfere with the other team's play. This means no pushing, shoving, or blocking the opponent's view. A player may cross the centerline under the net, as long as they do not interfere with the other team's play.<br><br>	
		</h3></font>
			<center> 
				<h1 style="color:yellow;">
					Winning the game: <br>
				</h1>
		</center>	
			<font color="white"><h3>	
				A volleyball game is played in sets, with the first team to reach 25 points winning the set. If the game is tied at 24-24, the game continues until one team wins by a two-point margin. The match is usually played best out of five sets, with the team that wins three sets declared the winner.<br>Remember, volleyball is not just about winning, it's about having fun, staying active, and building friendships. So, get out there, play fair, and enjoy the game!
