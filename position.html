					Middle Blocker<br>
				</h1>

						The opposite hitter is the right-handed version of the outside hitter. They deliver most of the team's attacks from the right side of the court, and they need to have a combination of power, accuracy, and versatility to be successful. They often have to adjust to different sets and angles, so they need to be able to adapt quickly.

				<h1 style="color:yellow;">
					Libero:<br>
				</h1>
			</center>
					<font color="white"><h3>
						The libero is the team's defensive specialist. They wear a different-colored jersey and have special rules that allow them to play in the back row without counting as a substitution. They are responsible for digging up the opposing team's attacks and passing the ball to their teammates to set up an attack. They need to have great reflexes, speed, and accuracy to make successful digs. If you love being the unsung hero of the team, then the libero position might be for you! Each position in volleyball requires different skills, but all of them require teamwork, communication, and a passion for the game. So, find the position that suits your style, and get ready to play your heart out on the court!
